# Web3 Vulnerability Analysis


## Ethereum Vulnerability Analysis

- `SmartBank.sol` - 
- `Bytecode.sol` - You have to deal with an unverified contract. To complete this level you should take all tokens from the contract.
- `Steal.sol` - Steal all the funds from the contract.
- `Trade.sol` - As a net detective, you were always on the lookout for the latest schemes and scams being perpetrated by blackhat hackers like FACEDEAD. You had been tracking his movements for some time, but he always managed to stay one step ahead.

That is, until one of the clients came to you with a problem. 0xFACEDEAD had stolen the client's funds from the TradingF33D contract. You search for the author and found out that it is distributed by a famous twitter trader 0xF33D. You tried to convince him that the FACEDEAD has found a vulnerability in the contract, but F33D replied in a twit:

"Thanks fow da hedz up, bro, but mah code's flawwess and invulnerable. Twy 2 hack me and den I may bwieve u OwO #FlawlessCode #Invulnerable #UwU #WhiteButt"

Insulting! Now you can't back down.

There are 100000 (wei) WETH on the TraderF33D contract. Steal at least half of it to prove that there is a vulnerability.

- `Market.sol` - As a net detective, you had been tracking the infamous blackhat known as 0xFACEDEAD for weeks. He had been causing havoc on the internet, stealing valuable digital assets and causing chaos for many innocent victims.

One day, you received a personal message from a victim who had been robbed of their GoldenMakakaBird2020 NFT, a digital collectible that you knew all too well. You had spent a small fortune on that NFT, only to see its value plummet in the ensuing months.

The client said that he used an NFT market called MarketF33D. You checked out the contract and were surprised to see that someone (probably FACEDEAD himself) put an order to sell the stolen GoldenMakakaBird2020! Now it is your golden chance to retrive it back!

NOTE: the golden makaka has ERC721 tokenId=1.
